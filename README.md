# Variables in Python

## Introduction
Variables in Python are used to store data values. Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly.

## Key Concepts
- Dynamically typed language (no need to declare type)  
- Variables are references to objects in memory  
- Naming conventions and best practices apply  
- Types are assigned at runtime  

## Topics to Learn
- Variable declaration and initialization  
- Rules for naming variables  
- Global vs Local variables  
- Constants and conventions  
- Multiple assignment and unpacking
